						I am currently majoring in Sports Administration at the University of Cincinnati and will receive my Bachelor’s Degree in the summer of 2017. Despite entering the University of Cincinnati as a Mechanical Engineer and had to play catch up in Sports Administration
						when I transferred a year ago, I have eagerly put my foot into the sports industry by taking advantage of various volunteering opportunities, leading an undergraduate research study with one of my professors and pursuing ticket sales experience
						in sports with the University of Cincinnati Ticket Office and the Akron Racers.
					</p>

					<p>
						I'm also very proud of the work that our Society of Sports Leaders does for inspiring the future leaders and pioneers of the sports industry. I am always willing to step up and help out our organization any way I can whether it be joining our Career Fair/Symposium
						Committee to help procure teams and talent to participate in our annual Society of Sports Leaders Career Fair, represent SSL as a volunteer for UC Fan First at football games when they are short numbered and need volunteers, and recently agreeing
						to take on the planning and logistics of our SSL group trip to Indianapolis to tour and network with collegiate and professional organizations along with anything else the President of SSL needs.
					</p>

					<p>
						After I complete my capstone internship next summer and graduate I hope to land an entry level sales position with a professional or collegiate sports organization and use my previous experiences to perform very well right off the bat. I plan to move
						up the ladder and eventually land a Director of Ticket Sales position at a team, or maybe move towards sponsorships and become a manager there. The dream is to one day become a Chief Revenue/Financial Officer of a Division 1 Athletics Department
						or a Major League professional team.
					</p>

				<!-- ========== MY SKILLS ========== -->
				<div class='columnheader'>
					<h1>Skills and Experience</h1>
				</div>

				<div class='myskills-text'>
					<p>
						As I mentioned before, I’m currently on a path leading towards sales, at the moment more specifically ticket sales, in collegiate and professional sports. I’ve received ticket sales experience in Division 1 Athletics working for the UC Ticket Office running
						the Fan First Center where we generated $3300 in ticket sales last season up from $1000 they did the previous year. The professional sports ticket sales experience I have so far is I completed this summer a ticket sales/community relations internship
						with the Akron Racers, one of six women’s national fast pitch softballs teams in the country.
					</p>
					<p>
						A lot of people even in Akron, down the road of the stadium no less, never heard of the Akron Racers so it is a real challenge trying to sell a lesser known or unknown product when cold calling businesses and non-profit organizations or going out to places
						in the area in person. It's definitely not the same as at UC when obviously everyone knows our athletics and especially easier to sell tickets to current fans in the arena when I ran the Fan First Center during our basketball season. What was nice
						about just us three interns doing the selling is we got to approach our two supervisors with new ideas and tweak things and roll with it. This internship would have been very daunting if we hadn't received professional sales consulting from Kathy
						Burrows, the owner of Sold Out Seating who has worked with teams in the NBA, WNBA, MLB, NHL so it was a tremendous opportunity to learn all summer. She came in every other week to help us with our sales plans and help us execute better to work towards
						her ambitious goal of doubling attendance from last year.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm glad I picked a small team to work for regardless as I got as much hands on sales experience possible in my opinion. I was told by my supervisor that the Racers increased ticket sales by 10-15% from last season so I'm very happy I was able to help
						them achieve that. The experiences I have had in the short amount of time have at times pushed me out of my comfort zone, which have allowed me to mature as a confident and competent professional. Upon graduation, I hope to find a firm that has
						a culture of developing young salesmen that has a high rate of landing full time sales careers in professional sports.

							Professional Sports Teams’ Marketing Efforts in Columbus, Ohio (July 2015 - June 2016) <br> View my research <a href="/SEVTFinalPoster.pdf">here</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							The purpose of this study was to chronicle the efforts made by several professional sports franchises to gain a share of the Columbus, Ohio market. Specifically, we examined if and how these teams, which generally share a cooperative relationship, compete
							for a share of this neutral market. This study served both as a history of the Columbus sports market, and as a granular look at how professional sports franchises balance their relationship as competitors and collaborators. This information will
							help future scholars and practitioners in sport, marketing, management, and other fields by shedding light on each side’s strategy, and potential areas for mutual benefit.
						</p>
						<p>
							I was fortunate enough to interview front office executives of the Cleveland Browns, Cincinnati Bengals, Indianapolis Colts and the Columbus Sports Commission. The research was awarded a $1700 research grant from the Undergraduate Research Committee in
							Human Services which gave me the opportunity to present it at the 2016 Sports Entertainment and Venues Tomorrow Conference at the University of South Carolina as a poster presentation.
